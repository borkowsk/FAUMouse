**FAUMouse3 is a package for recording mouse movement on the screen via the web**

The tool consists of a server part and a browser part:
- On the server side there are two programs written in C++ - *wwwserver* and *mousereg3*
- On the client's side there is a program in JavaScript language with an overlay 
in the form of the *P5.min.js* library from Processing

The following packages are required to run:
- GIT (optional)
- make (rather present on every linux)
- g++ (rather present on every linux)
- cmake
- boost library
- magic library (required by `fasada-core`, but not used in this project)
- Processing.org with P5 mode to edit the data collector script (optional)

*On UBUNTU, the necessary packages are installed as follows:*

sudo apt-get install git

sudo apt-get install cmake

sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

sudo apt-get install libmagic-dev

*and possibly make and g++*

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install build-essential

sudo apt-get install g++

*The installation directory contains:*

- instalacja_pl.md - _polish version of this file_
- inslalling_en.md - _this file_
- install.sh - _bash script used to compile and prepare the application to run_
- start.sh - _bash script that runs the compiled application and dedicated web server_ 
- stop.sh - _a script used to close the site, created anew each time by the startup script_
- IPs.txt - _the result of checking the network environment_ (_using_ *ifconfig* )
- screen.ini - _color configuration of the terminal used in scripts_
- service.log - _mousereg3's output from a previous or current run_
- src/regmouse3_main.cpp - _mousereg3 service application source code_
- src/regmouse3 - _service application, if the compilation was successful_
- private/ - _folder for collected data_
- public/ - _directory whose content is visible through the web server_. The key is the *index.html* file, which should be edited by needs. Just in case, there is a copy of it called *index_demo.html*
- public/MouseRegJs/ - _catalog with recorder and P5 library_. It may also contain other files generated by Processing
- public/MouseRegJs/MouseRegJs.js - _browser-based mouse recorder_.
- fasada_core/ - _an imported directory with a source code for web server and libraries for communication between the server and the websites using it_

Directions for use:

1) Run:

./install.sh

If it comes to an end it will display the IP addresses that can be used

2) Run:

./start.sh

The local version of the website will be launched. A browser window should appear with a page in the `./public/` directory that contains a link to the logging application. If the registration works, a `mouse * .raw` file should appear in the `./private/` directory

3) Run:

./stop.sh

The local service will be closed and the information about it's unavailability will appear in the browser window

4) Start the service with the following parameters: Service IP and PORT. You need to choose the correct IP !!! The port number can be anything but four digits. Below is an example of calling from my laptop's IP IN A LOCAL NETWORK.

./start.sh  192.168.1.104 8888

If the selected IP will be available globally, the service should work globally, at least in `Firefox`.

**Currently, the correct operation of the dedicated website has been tested on the `UBUNTU 16.04` and `18.04` platform and the client in the local network on the `Firefox` browser in the `UBUNTU` system and the client on `Windows`. An invalid activity has been detected on `Chrome` that does not seem to transmit data, only the header**
